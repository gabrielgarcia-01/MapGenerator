# Final Project Report (Map Generator)

## Preface
### General Idea
The general idea behind the map generator was to implement a noise algorithm (Perlin) to generate random terrain, and then draw it in a swing window, or save to a file.
### Perlin noise
Perlin noise is a noise algorithm that generates random values between 0 and 1 based on an X and Y coordinate, implemented in such a way that height values close to each other in a cartesian plane will have a sort of smoothing effect.
